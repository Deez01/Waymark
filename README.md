## Frontend Setup 
The frontend is a React Native frontend and it should hot reload when you are updating the UI also donwload the expo app to run this frontend

## Backend Setup
The backend is using convex. This will keep it simple when using it be wary about the size of imgs you guys upload make sure none of them are png's if they are not important because it could cost us money. Dont make an account for convex either `npm convex dashboard` will be for testing any of the backend stuff you can use console.log and see those in the dashboard.
